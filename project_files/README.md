# Project files
This directory contains files that are generated by the analysis scripts.
In principle, the whole directory can be deleted and created again by re-running all the scripts.

Dependening on their purpose, those files are saved under dedicated sub-directories:

## Raw data files: `raw/`
This sub-directory's purpose is to contain "local" copies of raw data files that were uploaded to the raw data bucket(s), which are the primary input of any analysis.
They notably represent the starting point of the various repoducibility tracks.

The files in this sub-directory are typically fetched by calling `cytoreason.shared.assets::prepare_raw_data`, whose default base output directory when called in the context of a project is set to `project_files/raw/` (See argument `outdir` in the function's man page).

## Asset files: `assets/`
This sub-direcotry is the base directory for all the shared assets that the various analysis scripts use as input or generate as output.

The files in this sub-directory are typically either:
  * created and explicitly saved by analysis scripts 
  * or fetched by calling `cytoreason.shared.assets::prepare_data` or `cytoreason.shared.assets::prepare_asset`, whose default base output directory when called in the context of a project is set to `project_files/assets/` (See argument `outdir` in the function's man page).

## Cache files: `cache/`
This sub-directory's purpose is to hold the cache files that are generated by `call_with_cache`, whose default base cache directory when called in the context of a project is set to (See argument `.cachedir`)
